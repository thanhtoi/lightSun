After pulling back and play, right now we can turn up and down and move back and forth to be able to observe the tower and the sun.
Use key combination (W(up), S(Down), A(Left), D(Right)) to move player.
In the upper left corner of the screen there is a button 'Edit Sun' which when clicked will show you an input popup where you can enter the longitude, latitude, date and time as well the rate at which time passes during the day time.

## Describe
In the input section, it will check whether the input value is correct with the actual data and will report an error to the user.
In addition, the input has a 'placeholder' to help the typer understand what to type,
Also the input fields can only enter numbers.
- Hint: if you want to observe the sun and light passing quickly, you should enter the field “time speed greater than 2000”
